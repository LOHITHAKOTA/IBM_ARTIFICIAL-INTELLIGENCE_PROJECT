# üè® Hotel Sentiment Analysis

This project performs **sentiment analysis** on hotel reviews using **Python**, with a focus on comparing the performance of three machine learning algorithms:  
- **Multinomial Naive Bayes**  
- **Bernoulli Naive Bayes**  
- **Logistic Regression**  

The main goal is to classify reviews as either **positive** or **negative** and evaluate the effectiveness of different algorithms.

## üöÄ Features

- **Predict Sentiments**: Classifies hotel reviews as positive or negative based on text content.
- **Compare Algorithms**: Evaluates the performance of Multinomial Naive Bayes, Bernoulli Naive Bayes, and Logistic Regression.
- **Scalable Design**: Easily expandable to include other algorithms or datasets.

## üõ†Ô∏è Project Workflow

### Step 1: Data Import
- Load the dataset containing hotel reviews.
- Explore the dataset to understand the distribution of reviews and sentiment labels.

### Step 2: Data Preprocessing
- Clean the text data:
  - Remove stopwords, special characters, and HTML tags.
  - Convert text to lowercase.
- Tokenize and lemmatize text using NLP techniques.
- Handle missing or imbalanced data if necessary.

### Step 3: Vectorization
- Convert the preprocessed text data into numerical vectors using Scikit-learn's vectorization tools:
  - **CountVectorizer**: Converts text into a matrix of word counts (Bag of Words).

### Step 4: Predictions on Reviews
- Train and test the following machine learning models:
  - **Multinomial Naive Bayes**
  - **Bernoulli Naive Bayes**
  - **Logistic Regression**
- Evaluate the models using metrics like:
  - Accuracy
  - Precision
  - Recall
